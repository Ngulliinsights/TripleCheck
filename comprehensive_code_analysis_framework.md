## Usage Guidelines

### How to Apply This Framework

**For New Code Reviews:** Start with Core Quality Analysis (prompts 1-3) to ensure fundamental correctness, then progress through Architecture and Design Quality for structural assessment.

**For Legacy Code Assessment:** Begin with Reliability and Robustness (prompts 6-7) to identify immediate risks, then work through the entire framework systematically.

**For Performance Optimization:** Focus on prompts 2, 11, and 12, which specifically address performance, scalability, and data processing efficiency.

**For Security Audits:** Prioritize prompt 3 (Security Assessment) along with prompt 13 (Compliance) for comprehensive security evaluation.

**For Maintenance Planning:** Emphasize prompts 5, 8, and 15 to understand long-term maintainability and evolution requirements.

### Customization Tips

**Language-Specific Adaptations:** Modify prompts to include language-specific best practices, frameworks, and common pitfalls relevant to your technology stack.

**Domain-Specific Considerations:** Add industry-specific requirements such as real-time processing for trading systems or safety-critical considerations for medical applications.

**Team Maturity Levels:** Adjust the depth and complexity of analysis based on team experience and project requirements.

This framework transforms code analysis from a reactive process into a proactive quality assurance strategy, ensuring comprehensive evaluation across all critical dimensions of software quality.
